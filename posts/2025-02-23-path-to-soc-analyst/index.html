 If you’re trying to break into cybersecurity with no previous cyber, engineering, or IT experience, the best way to break into the industry is as a SOC analyst.
SOC Analysts are cybersecurity analysts responsible for monitoring corporate networks for potential threats and intrusions. While certainly not an introductory IT/ engineering role, it is the closest thing to an introductory role in security."><meta name=author content="Rahul Zhade"><link href=https://unpkg.com/@master/normal.css rel=stylesheet><script src=https://unpkg.com/@master/style@1.5.0></script>

They are responsible both for monitoring and validating alerts generated through the SIEM system, and prioritizing alerts for further investigation.</p><p>SOC Analyst positions are ideal as an introductory cybersecurity career as:</p><ol><li>It’s a great introduction to the entirety of a corporate cyber environment; you’ll get exposure to cloud security, network security, application security and everything in between</li><li>At the junior level, you’re expected to have a broad breadth of knowledge, but not necessarily great depth; this makes it easier to study for in interviews</li><li>There are a great number of resources available online (for free!) to study for this career</li></ol><h2 id=requisite-skills-to-pass-interviews>Requisite Skills to Pass Interviews</h2><p>In order to be able to pass a junior SOC analyst interview, you’ll need to have knowledge of several technical concepts, and also have some practice in some soft skills.</p><p>Note that many of the technical skills overlap with that of an IT role; there’s a very easy transition between IT administrators and SOC analysts, so studying for both roles is very similar.</p><h3 id=technical-skills>Technical Skills</h3><ul><li>Networking Fundamentals<ul><li>How does TCP/IP Work</li><li>DNS</li><li>Basics of OSI Model</li></ul></li><li>Operating Systems Security<ul><li>In order of importance<ol><li>Linux</li><li>Windows</li><li>Mac</li></ol></li></ul></li><li>Security Tools<ul><li>SIEM<ul><li>Splunk</li><li>QRadar</li><li>ArcSight</li></ul></li><li>Firewalls</li><li>Antiviruses</li><li>Endpoint Detection</li></ul></li><li>Log Analysis<ul><li>Splunk</li><li>SQL</li></ul></li><li>Scripting + Automation<ul><li>Python + Bash</li></ul></li><li>Threat Intelligence and Vulnerability Management<ul><li>Understanding CVEs</li><li>Threat Actors</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=soft-skills>Soft Skills</h3><ul><li>Communication Skills<ul><li>Report writing</li><li>Communicating with stakeholders</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=acquiring-skills>Acquiring Skills</h2><p>There’s a great number of bootcamps and practice available online to start building out your skillset. Some are structured courses, others are YouTube videos/ series that are ideal for self- study:</p><h3 id=josh-madakor-youtubehttpswwwyoutubecomjoshmadakor><a href=https://www.youtube.com/@JoshMadakor>Josh Madakor YouTube</a></h3><p>Josh Madakor is a YouTuber whose channel is all about IT and SOC related content; his content is all about on breaking into the IT industry. It is unstructured, so it might be harder to follow, however the content is completely free.</p><h3 id=google-it-support-certificatehttpswwwcourseraorgprofessional-certificatesgoogle-it-support><a href=https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support>Google IT Support Certificate</a></h3><p>The official Google IT Support Certificate is a 6 month course that aims to take you from 0 to a certified IT administrator. Taking the course itself is free, but if you want the certification, you will need to pay.</p><h3 id=soc-core-skills---blackhillshttpswwwantisyphontrainingcomcoursesoc-core-skills-with-john-strand><a href=https://www.antisyphontraining.com/course/soc-core-skills-with-john-strand/>SOC Core Skills - BlackHills</a></h3><p>BlackHills is an industry renowned consultancy company, and they’ve put together a SOC Core Skills course. This will be a lot more structured than Josh Madakor’s Youtube, and more focused than the Google IT Support Certificate. It is also priced on a Pay as You Will structure.</p><h3 id=hacktheboxhttpswwwhacktheboxcom><a href=https://www.hackthebox.com/>HackTheBox</a></h3><p>HackTheBox provides both structured content and online labs for you to practice your skills on a lab environment. It does have a paid subscription, so you should rely on the first few courses first before paying for it.</p><p>The two courses/ labs I’d recommend for a introductory SOC analyst are:</p><ul><li><a href=https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/operating-system-fundamentals>HackTheBox Operating Systems Fundamentals</a></li><li><a href=https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/soc-analyst>HackTheBox SOC Analyst</a></li></ul><h2 id=certifications>Certifications</h2><p>Once you’ve acquired all of the core skills for the job, certifications might be a good way to increase the clout of your resume. However, make sure you’ve completed all of the free things above first before you pay for a certification. I’ll repeat DO ALL OF THE THINGS ABOVE BEFORE YOU PAY FOR A CERTIFICATION.</p><p>Having certifications on your resume may increase your likelihood of getting an interview, but they’re no substitute for having knowledge of the material; something that you can do for free before getting the cert.</p><p>The best certifications to get are:</p><ul><li>~<a href=https://www.comptia.org/certifications/it-fundamentals>CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)</a>~<ul><li>Industry recognized certification</li><li>Costs</li></ul></li><li>~<a href=https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security>CompTIA Security+</a>~<ul><li>Basic security concepts, networking + risk management</li><li>Very common intro level certification for security</li></ul></li><li>~<a href=https://www.giac.org/certifications/security-essentials-gsec/>GIAC Security Essentials</a>~</li></ul><h2 id=potential-career-timeline-for-soc>Potential Career Timeline (for SOC)</h2><p>This career path presumes full time studying; potentially over 4 hours a day. As such, the timeline might take shorter or longer than what is estimated here. IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF STUDYING to get understand the core skills, IT WILL TAKE EVEN MORE PRACTICING to get comfortable applying them. This is accelerating a 2 year degree program into 1 year, so expect it to be very intense and rigorous.</p><h3 id=1-month-timeline>1 Month timeline</h3><ol><li>Understand what it takes to become a security professional</li><li>Identify problem areas that need to be focused on</li><li>Sign up for a bootcamp</li></ol><h3 id=6-month-timeline>6 Month timeline</h3><ol><li>Complete IT bootcamp<ul><li>Reevaluate problem areas</li></ul></li><li>Check curriculum for certifications and see if enough knowledge to pass<ul><li>Study for those certs if you’re ready</li></ul></li><li>Start practicing in the wild (HackTheBox, etc.)</li></ol><h3 id=12-month-timeline>12 Month timeline</h3><ol><li>Complete SOC bootcamp (potentially)<ul><li>Reevaluate problem areas</li></ul></li><li>Check curriculum for SOC certifications and see if enough knowledge to pass any<ul><li>Study for those certs if you’re ready</li></ul></li><li>Start polishing resume, etc.</li></ol></div></article><footer class=py:24><div class="f:fade-30 f:14 mb:8"></div><div class="f:fade-60 f:12">Theme <a class=f:bold href=https://github.com/serkodev/holy _target=_blank>Holy</a></div></footer></div></div></body></html>
