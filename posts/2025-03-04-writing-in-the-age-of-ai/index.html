LLMs have decimated the role of a professional writer.

Even as an engineer, I’ve been able to increase my writing efficiency almost to the order of <a href=https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/full-time-equivalent>0.5 FTE</a>— reports and other prose that I might’ve previously needed another engineer to help with, I’m able to do alone in half the time and twice as well.</p><p>Despite these shifts, I find writing to be therapeutic, and, in a work context, very useful to rubber duck ideas. I’m able to construct much better arguments and come to much better conclusions when I write out my thoughts, rather than when I need to come to a snap judgment on a Zoom call. Narratives are much easier to challenge when you can write and read them back to yourself.</p><p>In the broadest sense, AI kills that part of writing that makes you a better thinker, that part of writing that is therapeutic, and that part of writing that is personal.</p><p>At the same time, the efficiency gains of AI cannot be understated.

No AI involved, maybe some Perplexity for search, but for the most part just pen to paper.</p><p>The outline is where I do most of my rhetorical thinking. <em>Does this argument make sense?

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=drafting>Drafting</h3><p>Drafting is where I turn my outline into stream-of-consciousness words on paper. I don’t care about grammar, correctness, or style here; it’s just about fleshing out the outline.</p><p>I use the <a href=https://bear.app>Bear app</a> to do my drafting as it is completely offline, and because it uses Markdown for formatting. I’ve worked at GitHub for long enough that my internal monologue is in Markdown, so for me it’s much easier to draft using this specification than something like Google Docs.</p><h3 id=grammarly>Grammarly</h3><p>After my draft is complete., I plop it immediately into <a href=https://app.grammarly.com/>Grammarly</a> and have it edit the grammar for me. Why not directly into an LLM? Well, Grammarly doesn’t overly update the text itself (especially with the free version!)— this step is only for correcting my syntax and grammar. Style and tone come later, the focus of this step is to have a solid foundation for the writing.</p><h3 id=claude>Claude</h3><p>The final step is to run my essay through Claude. I’ve found Claude works better than ChatGPT for prose editing, but your mileage may vary.</p><p>I do two runs with Claude:</p><h4 id=evaluation>Evaluation</h4><p>The first run is to see if Claude thinks the prose properly flows. In the past, this was something I’d get through a peer review from a classmate or a colleague. However, you can now get instant feedback from an LLM. Here’s the prompt I use for this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Please evaluate the following prose for consistency and flow between paragraphs. Drop notes on any paragraphs that need better transitions.
</code></pre><h4 id=copy-editing>Copy Editing</h4><p>The second run is to edit and rewrite my prose. Here’s the prompt I use for this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Please lightly edit the following prose for grammar, technical correctness, and style according to the following style guide.
</code></pre><p>To generate my style guide, I ran several of my prior writings through Claude to generate a reproducible style guide. Here’s mine for my blog:</p><pre tabindex=0><code># Personal Blog Style Guide

## Tone and Voice
* Write in first person using contractions (I&#39;ve, don&#39;t, it&#39;s)
* Balance technical authority with conversational accessibility
* Use direct questions to engage readers
* Maintain candid authenticity without excessive formality

## Structure
* Use clear, concise headings (one to five words)
* Start with a personal anecdote or problem statement
* Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)
* Organize content from foundational concepts to more advanced applications

## Formatting
* Bold key concepts when first introduced
* Format code, commands, or technical terms with backticks (algorithm)
* Use blockquotes (&gt;) for summaries, takeaways, or emphasized recommendations
* Create bullet lists for examples, options, or multiple related items
* Use numbered lists for sequential steps
* Include specific numbers, metrics and timestamps where applicable

## Content Approach
* Structure around problem-solution frameworks with practical, actionable advice
* Define technical terms at first mention while respecting reader intelligence
* Vary paragraph length (2-5 sentences) with clear topic sentences
* Balance technical terminology with everyday language and occasional contemporary phrases
* Link to relevant external resources with descriptive anchor text
</code></pre><p>I separate these into two steps to ensure that the majority of the voice still sounds like me— the goal is to be AI-enabled; not AI-powered. The majority of the prose should be written by a human, an LLM should only act as an editor.</p><h2 id=concessions>Concessions</h2><p>I’ll concede that, as a post-LLM era LLM user, I’m not as LLM-native as the kids are. There are definitely ways of simplifying and enhancing my flow even further.</p><p>Rubber ducking with an AI to prove out a narrative may also be a good usage of AI, in the pre-drafting stage. Chatting through an agenda to see that the thesis makes sense, and to put together the structure of an outline, would save a lot of time on writing and rewriting.</p><p>Eventually, I will need to embrace using AI to draft my writing too. The efficiency gains of doing so are such that this is likely an inevitable next step to compete with my peers. I’d like to start writing with AI recommendations inline, similar to how Copilot Code suggestions. Using the style guide and examples should make it close enough to human-generated output; sure, it takes the soul out of writing, but most of what I write (progress reports, issue write-ups, etc.) doesn’t need much of a soul at all.</p><p>Ultimately, AI is just a tool just like any other— using it will make you that much better while misusing it will make you that much worse. Striking the right balance comes down to discipline and forethought.</p></div></article><footer class=py:24><div class="f:fade-30 f:14 mb:8"></div><div class="f:fade-60 f:12">Theme <a class=f:bold href=https://github.com/serkodev/holy _target=_blank>Holy</a></div></footer></div></div></body></html>
