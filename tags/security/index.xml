One such use case is generating rich UIs and text.
It’s much easier to read the output of an LLM if it’s properly styled and interactive. Reading large blobs of text can get unwieldy, and adding styling and interactive elements dynamically makes the output much more user-friendly and personalizable. This is known as a Generative UI; a User Interface that is generated in real-time by a generative AI.</description></item><item><title>Path to SOC Analyst: Breaking into Cybersecurity</title><link>https://blog.zhade.dev/posts/2025-02-23-path-to-soc-analyst/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.zhade.dev/posts/2025-02-23-path-to-soc-analyst/</guid><description>This was originally drafted as a Google doc for a friend.
If you’re trying to break into cybersecurity with no previous cyber, engineering, or IT experience, the best way to break into the industry is as a SOC analyst.
SOC Analysts are cybersecurity analysts responsible for monitoring corporate networks for potential threats and intrusions. While certainly not an introductory IT/ engineering role, it is the closest thing to an introductory role in security.</description></item><item><title>Setting Secure Hashing Parameters for Password Hashing</title><link>https://blog.zhade.dev/posts/2022-05-28-setting-secure-hashing-params/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.zhade.dev/posts/2022-05-28-setting-secure-hashing-params/</guid><description>TLDR: As of May 2022, I’d recommend using Argon2Id with the parameters recommended in RFC 9106
When trying to select the right way to protect your user’s passwords and credentials, there’s two things we need to consider. Firstly, we need to choose the right algorithm, one that is cryptographically secure. Secondly, we need to se the right parameters for the given algorithm to make it behave as securely as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
