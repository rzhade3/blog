While it seemed natural to think that embeddings were one-way functions that could not be reversed, research revealed that substantial semantic leakage was possible—even if direct reconstruction was not.
Embeddings turn a token—a word, subword, or symbol— into a vector that encodes its semantic meaning. However, these vectors are not unique; multiple tokens can map to the same vector, and as such are a lossy function.</description></item></channel></rss>
