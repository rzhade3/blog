But how should organizations approach tracking and prioritizing it?
In my opinion, instead of being a vulnerability in and of itself, prompt injection is a weakness that leads to other, more potent vulnerabilities. While it is true that prompt injection is undesirable, it is (at the current time) unsolvable, and as such tracking it as its own vulnerability leads to more overhead and less desirable security outcomes.</description></item><item><title>Secure Generative UIs with Grammar Constrained Decoding</title><link>https://blog.zhade.dev/posts/2025-04-29-secure-generative-uis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.zhade.dev/posts/2025-04-29-secure-generative-uis/</guid><description>LLMs are very powerful for generating arbitrary text, but they really shine when you ask them to generate structured output. One such use case is generating rich UIs and text.
It’s much easier to read the output of an LLM if it’s properly styled and interactive. Reading large blobs of text can get unwieldy, and adding styling and interactive elements dynamically makes the output much more user-friendly and personalizable. This is known as a Generative UI; a User Interface that is generated in real-time by a generative AI.</description></item></channel></rss>
